# TP2_Networking

## Description

I created this project  as part of Computer Network course. This practical work consists of developing a system for sending fuel prices from gas stations, as well as allowing the most affordable price for a particular type of fuel to be consulted. This system was developed using the unconnected UDP protocol, and using both IPv4 and Ipv6. To ensure delivery and receipt of messages between the server program and the client program, both client and server implement a delivery acknowledgment message exchange algorithm.

This practical work consisted of the implementation of two programs, the client and the server, in the Python language (2.7). They receive input parameters as explained below:

```
cliente <ip/nome> <porta> 
servidor <porta> 
```
